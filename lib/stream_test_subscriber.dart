/// stream_test_subscriber is a Dart package that simplifies testing streams
/// by providing a straightforward API for subscribing to and asserting values from a stream.
/// It allows you to easily collect emitted values, verify their sequence,
/// and handle asynchronous stream events in tests.
/// Ideal for unit testing stream-based code with minimal boilerplate.
